"""
rst2pdf extension to build a songbook.

The songbook is a mix of a normal reST document (to render as PDF) and a set of
songbooks rendered by other means and available as pdf.

Currently there is a base ``include-pdf`` directive implemented. What is
planned is a tighter interaction with chordlab, e.g. to fix the page numbers in
the songsheets and read the songs titles, this kind of stuff. That's TODO.

The usage is something like::

    rst2pdf -e songbook -o sample.pdf sample.rst

See `sample.rst` for an input file example.
